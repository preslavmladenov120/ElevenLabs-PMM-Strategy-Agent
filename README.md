# ElevenLabs Strategic Representative: GTM Logic and Architecture
This repository contains the underlying "Revenue Architecture" and GTM frameworks used to power my ElevenLabs Strategic Representative (AI Agent).
In the /strategy folder, you will find my complete campaign: "From Gatekeeper to Growth Partner." This strategy outlines how ElevenLabs Agents can transform the standard, cold "we decided to move forward with other candidates" email into a warm, voice-first strategic roadmap for candidate success.

1. Project Overview

As an unconventional Product Marketing Manager, I know that my CV doesn’t scream "traditional PMM" at first glance. That is exactly why I wanted to make your own product vouch for me. I built this agent to help me properly promote myself as a Senior Product Marketer with a storytelling, high-conversion approach, demonstrating my value through the platform itself even before the interview stages. Because I prioritize privacy and user experience, I have disabled the "Store Call Audio" function to respect the recruiter’s privacy. This ensures an environment where you can freely stress-test the agent and the strategic narratives I’ve uploaded to it.

2. The System Prompt (Logic Layer)

** Persona and Tone Architecture **
 - The "Deal Hunter" Persona: Influenced by the "Deal Hunter" persona I developed for PhoneArena, the agent is instructed to be obsessive about value. It moves beyond simply listing my skills and instead showcases how these abilities directly help ElevenLabs reach its strategic goals and increase revenue.

 - Technical Empathy: The agent is trained to bridge the gap between user pain points—like the "2 AM fire drills" or "laptops that sound like jet engines" examples from my GTM campaigns—and high-level executive goals like "Margin Recovery".

 - Low-Latency Conversational Flow: I optimized the agent to prove the power of the ElevenLabs platform by maintaining a natural, human-like dialogue. To achieve this "instant" feel, I configured the agent with the Gemini 2.5 Flash LLM, a 0.70 temperature for creative flair, a 200-token limit to ensure punchy responses, and the thinking budget turned off to minimize response time.

** Strategic Narrative Pillars **

I have embedded core GTM frameworks directly into the logic to handle complex inquiries:

 - Margin Recovery Logic: The agent views a "Cancelled" status as a request for a better deal, referencing my framework for bypassing platform taxes to reclaim 30% margins.

 - The "Fragile Sync Engine" Argument: A competitive intelligence layer used to disarm "In-House build" objections by highlighting the hidden maintenance costs of building something in-house instead of using a plug-and-play service.

 - High-Velocity Proof: The agent explains my "Content Engine" model, which uses AI to achieve a 6x increase in output (12 technical articles per shift) while maintaining senior-level quality.

- Zero-Source Narrative Transformation: To prove resourcefulness, the agent can recount how I turned two paragraphs of repetitive text into an 8-page essential narrative for Strahm Building Solutions. This serves as proof that I can build a premium brand identity from "zero source material," a critical skill for early-stage product launches.


3. Conversational Guardrails and Conversion

Conversational Guardrails & Conversion

To ensure the agent remains a high-value asset and protects the professional narrative, I have implemented specific guardrails that manage the flow of the interview process:

 - Outcome-Based Redirection: Every interaction is designed with a specific conversion goal: securing a live strategy session. If the conversation reaches a natural peak or a "thank you," the agent is programmed to pivot into a pitch for a 15-minute sync on how I would apply my Margin Recovery framework to ElevenLabs' current funnel.
   
 - Strict Salary Deferral and Value Pivot: To maintain professional leverage and focus on impact, the agent is hard-coded to redirect compensation inquiries. Instead of providing figures, it aligns with ElevenLabs’ "High Ownership" culture by emphasizing Outcome-Based Compensation—where "Outcome" is defined as the long-term growth of the platform's revenue and authority.
   
 - Competitive Neutrality and Strategic Positioning: When asked about competitors or "In-House" alternatives, the agent is restricted from disparaging other products. Instead, it uses a "Resilient Foundation" argument to highlight the hidden engineering costs of DIY solutions, positioning ElevenLabs as the only choice for mission-critical reliability.
 
 - The "Human-in-the-Loop" Handoff: The agent is instructed to never "hallucinate" internal ElevenLabs data or pricing. If a recruiter asks a question outside of my personal professional scope, the agent gracefully defers to the human team while expressing excitement about the "Agent" pivot, ensuring 100% brand safety.

4. GTM Assets & Strategic Playbooks
   
To provide concrete evidence of my "Technical-to-Human" approach, I have included summaries of the core frameworks embedded in this agent’s logic:

 - Vested GTM Framework: A proprietary 7-part narrative structure designed specifically for developer tools. It moves from "Emotional Awareness" (addressing the 2 AM fire drill) to "Technical Proof," culminating in sales enablement assets like Battlecards that disarm DIY objections.

 - Vivacom "System Thinking" Case Study: An analysis of how I re-engineered team performance by "routing" customers based on personality types. This demonstrates my ability to apply non-linear problem-solving to hit complex commercial targets.

 - The Strahm Transformation: A case study in high-agency brand building where I transformed two paragraphs of repetitive brochure text into an 8-page essential narrative, proving I can build premium brand authority from "zero source material".

 - 4-Phase Partner Lifecycle Playbook: A strategic framework focused on the "Rebate & Retention" engine. This playbook outlines how to manage the partner journey—from initial onboarding to long-term loyalty—by using financial incentives and performance milestones to secure the revenue funnel.
